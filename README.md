● Developed web interfaces for two-factor authentication using Java to mitigate unauthorized
access, enhancing security for users.
● To improve security for applications, integrated a source code scanning plugin into a Jenkins
pipeline, triggered by new commits to GitHub. Upon receiving a vulnerability clearance report
outputted by the plugin, the pipeline automatically provisions virtual machines on Azure,
reducing the manual error.
● Built CI/CD pipelines using GitHub actions, automating testing, building, and deployment
processes.
